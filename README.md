## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide for setting up a Kubernetes cluster at the University Adolfo Ibáñez. The cluster will serve as a learning and testing environment for students and faculty interested in Kubernetes and container orchestration.

## Prerequisites

Before you start building a Kubernetes cluster, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

- **Linux Hosts**: Kubernetes primarily runs on Linux. You will need at least two Linux hosts to create a basic cluster. Common choices include Ubuntu, CentOS, or Fedora.

- **Container Runtime**: Kubernetes uses container runtimes to run containers. Docker is a popular choice, but you can also use containerd, cri-o, or others.

- **Hostnames and Network Configuration**:
  - Each host should have a unique hostname.
  - All nodes should have full network connectivity with each other.
  - Ensure that DNS is working correctly between nodes, and each node can resolve the others' hostnames.

- **Hardware Resources**:
  - Each node should have a minimum of 2GB RAM.
  - A CPU with at least two cores is recommended.
  - Sufficient disk space for container images and Kubernetes components.

- **Kubernetes Binaries**: Download the necessary Kubernetes binaries:
  - `kubectl`: The Kubernetes command-line tool.
  - `kubeadm`: The Kubernetes Cluster Bootstrap tool.
  - `kubelet`: The Kubernetes Node Agent.

- **Container Network Interface (CNI)**: Ensure that your chosen CNI plugin is properly configured on all nodes. This involves setting up network routing and policies.

- **Firewall Rules**: Configure firewall rules to allow traffic between Kubernetes nodes and components. Kubernetes uses various ports for communication; consult the official documentation for specific port requirements.

- **Network Plugin**: Choose a network plugin that fits your cluster requirements (e.g., Calico, Flannel, Cilium) and install it on all nodes.

- **Swap Disabled**: Disable swap on all nodes. Kubernetes recommends that swap be disabled for optimal performance and stability.

- **Container Runtime Configuration**: Configure your container runtime (e.g., Docker) to work with Kubernetes. Ensure that it supports the required version of the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).

- **SSH Access**: Ensure that you can SSH into all nodes from your management machine without a password. SSH key-based authentication is recommended.

- **NTP**: Synchronize the system clocks of all nodes using Network Time Protocol (NTP) or a similar time synchronization mechanism to ensure consistency.

- **Optional Ingress Controller**: If your applications will require external access via HTTP/HTTPS, consider setting up an Ingress controller such as Nginx Ingress or Traefik.


Ensure that you thoroughly review the official [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) documentation and the documentation of any specific tools or plugins you plan to use, as requirements may vary dependin3g on your environment and use case.


## Building the cluster

Follow these steps to set up your Kubernetes cluster:

### Configuring the static network 

To be able to define the static ip, we will have to define some parameters in the file:``` /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml```

```yaml
network:
  ethernets:
    <ethernet port>:
      dhcp4: false
      addresses:
        - <ip address>
      gateway4: <gateway>
      nameservers:
        addresses: [1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1]
  version: 2
``` 
you can see your ethernet port by executing the command ```ip a``` in linux

### Running the script

In this case we are using ubuntu server, so the delivered script to create our cluster is for the above mentioned operating system. 

To run the script we need 2 things :
 - be in sudo user (```sudo su```)
 - give administrator permissions to the script (```chmod +x install.sh```)

 Now we can run the script, it has the option to choose whether to configure the Head node, simply select this for the master node.

 In order to join the worker nodes with the Head node, we have to use the command provided by the script. This is like this:

```
kubeadm join 192.168.0.100:6443 --token 8tchu0.jrgzw1owketyocrd --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:05b1fc56c15434e3a4f318e612095b2f4134cde27cdc1e8ff5589977eb957c16 --cri-socket=unix:///var/run/cri-dockerd.sock
```

## Usage

Now that we have our cluster built correctly, we have to learn how to use it.
